Locpy

locpy is a simple python library I wrote a few months ago for an internal project. It allows you to quickly search large amounts of text for geographical locations and returns them as coordinates.

Dependencies---
nltk

How to use:

Download source and see test.py file: simply import the initiator module, and call search on a text sample. The library will return an array of locations with longitude and latitude for each discovered location.
